Philosophy
-------------------
The clear Focus was to develop a Framework in between the existing Big Ones,
which have quite some learning curve to get started and
the small, very low level ones, which make it neccessary to develop
quite a lot yourself.
There are good examples of both in the python community and there are 
good reasons for those frameworks to exists as well.

BUT 
PythonOnWheels' main objective is to make you focus on your webapp
and not on the Framework or the low-level coding. 
If you dont recognize you use it, it's just the way it's ment to be.
